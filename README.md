# SwiftUIArticles

**SwiftUIArticles** uses MarkdownUI to create an UI for articles. It takes inspiration from the Apple Health app articles. In keeping with that theme, horizontal images work best. The preview image's height will be slightly shorter than the full article image.

Create your content using the Article struct and feed it into the views you want to use.

## ArticlePreview
**ArticlePreview** can be used to preview the content of your article.

## ArticleView
**ArticleView** is the where the full content of the article can be seen. Feel free to use it in a navigation view or a sheet.
